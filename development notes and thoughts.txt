Logic for "begin" command has been mostly implemented. Need to add in delay timer.
Logic for "exit" command has been implemented.

Next:
Finish "begin" command logic (delay timer), press a button for hints (later --> when stories are included), "next" command to skip to next, "notes" command to add notes (consider making a new notes file).
	Add in "options" command
		After typing begin, user can just hit enter to begin or type "options" for some options
			Only ask questions with some keywords, change timer length, etc;

write "view" command logic

write "add/edit" command logic

Implement:
	Behavioral Mode vs Technical Mode
		(Choose on startup, can change any time)
	Anecdotes
		Instead of stories. Will just be a property of Questions object.

	Fix bug for when user enters a non-integer (try catch?)
	These methods:
		Edit keywords
		Edit anecdotes
